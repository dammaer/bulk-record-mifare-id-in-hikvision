# BULK RECORD MIFARE ID IN HIKVISION

## Overview
This script can bulk add mifare cards to Hikvision video intercom (or other device from Hikvision with internal mifare card reader) without manually adding them in the panelâ€™s web interface, as well as without using Hikvision iVMS software. First of all, this is necessary when the mifare_id of the cards is already known and they need to be duplicated in video intercom.

You can add mifare cards by first preparing a text file with mifare_id in hex format, then the script will create users with the name you specify, 5 cards in each user. Or each mifare card separately. It is also possible to completely clear all users with cards added to them.
