# BULK RECORD MIFARE ID IN HIKVISION

## Overview
This script can bulk add mifare cards to Hikvision video intercom (or other device from Hikvision with internal mifare card reader) without manually adding them in the panelâ€™s web interface, as well as without using Hikvision iVMS software. First of all, this is necessary when the mifare_id of the cards is already known and they need to be duplicated in video intercom.

You can add mifare cards by first preparing a text file with mifare_id in hex format, then the script will create users with the name you specify, 5 cards in each user. Or each mifare card separately. It is also possible to completely clear all users with cards added to them.

### :small_blue_diamond: Adding new mifare_id as argument value
```bash
# This will add new mifare cards to existing users called student 
# or create a new user student if the remaining users are full
python record_mifare_id.py -a 85EF77B4 7290FDE1 -n student
```
### :small_blue_diamond: Removing all users and their mifare cards
```bash
# This will remove all users with the name "student" and their mifare cards
python record_mifare_id.py -c -n student
```
### :warning: Note on mifare key hex
Some mifare card readers display the key value in reverse. For example, the NFC Tool (Android) application displays the 85EF77B4 key as 4B:77:FE:58 when read. This must be taken into account before use, otherwise mifare cards will not work!
